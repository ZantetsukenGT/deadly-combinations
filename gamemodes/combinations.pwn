	##      To-Do       ##
	######################

	    *FEATURES
			- Save clans and countries on ini data system, and add it to /stats (Utilize those stats more basically)
			- Add matches to /delete - might need to assign an ID for each match to identify it?
			- "automode" so it just keeps playing bases
		 	- /vote clearscores - clears servers scores and should require atleast 50% of player votes
			- Config cmds: "cbug" | "votetype", so u can force ppl to vote for random round -1
		 	- Make more config dialogs like /config audio, so there is less clutter with too many config commands
		 	- Make netstats parser to better utilize the data
		 	- Commands: /int - http://files.sa-mp.com/interiors.txt
		 	- choose previous weapons option from gunmenu
			- find some use for the textures added in RC5-3
				* there's a heart texture, put next to round health?
			- make it easy for ppl to report bugs, HTTP() in combination with a /report cmd?

		*BUGS
			- None

		*SUGGESTIONS
	        - None

		*NOTES
			- None

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*-
Function:
	sscanf
Params:
	string[] - String to extract parameters from.
	format[] - Parameter types to get.
	{Float,_}:... - Data return variables.
Return:
	0 - Successful, not 0 - fail.
Notes:
	A fail is either insufficient variables to store the data or insufficient
	data for the format string - excess data is disgarded.

	A string in the middle of the input data is extracted as a single word, a
	string at the end of the data collects all remaining text.

	The format codes are:

	c - A character.
	d, i - An integer.
	h, x - A hex number (e.g. a colour).
	f - A float.
	s - A string.
	z - An optional string.
	pX - An additional delimiter where X is another character.
	'' - Encloses a litteral string to locate.
	u - User, takes a name, part of a name or an id and returns the id if they're connected.

	Now has IsNumeric integrated into the code.

	Added additional delimiters in the form of all whitespace and an
	optioanlly specified one in the format string.
